# treereduce

This is a simple python script for subsetting Newick trees based on SNP distance.
A specific file structure is expected for the directory containing the trees.
The order of scripts to run is reduce.py -> convert.py -> download.py

For the download script, both sratoolkit and NCBI datasets need to be installed.
